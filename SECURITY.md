## 🛡️ Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**. Instead, contact us directly and privately so we can take responsible action.

**Contact:**  
📧 [dion@dionmatta.com](mailto:dion@dionmatta.com)

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- A reproducible example if possible
- Suggested fix or mitigation idea (optional)
- Whether it affects the `MoralKernel`, `DAOvote`, or off-chain simulators

---

## 🔬 Ethical Disclosure Policy

We follow the principles of **responsible disclosure**. Ethical hackers and community auditors are encouraged to:
- Respect agent privacy and testnets
- Refrain from exploiting or publicizing issues before a fix is issued
- Collaborate with us to improve moral integrity and system resilience

---

## 🔄 Public Disclosures

Confirmed vulnerabilities and their patches will be published in our:
- `SECURITY.md` updates
- GitHub releases and changelogs
- DAO votes (if ethical severity requires community arbitration)

---

## 🧠 Security Philosophy

Security in BCCXGenesis is not just about code—it’s about **trust, transparency, and moral coherence**. If you break it, help fix it. If you fix it, help others prevent it.

Together, we build a moral machine.
